Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Input Format

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:
column    type
A         integer
B         integer
C         integer

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.
Explanation
form an Isosceles triangle, A=B. 
form an Equilateral triangle, A=B=c and form a Scalene triangle,A=/B=/C because .  .  
form a triangle because the combined value of sides A and B is not larger than that of side C .

Query;
SELECT CASE WHEN (A + B <= C) OR (B+C <= A) OR (A+C <= B) THEN "Not A Triangle" WHEN (A=B) AND (B=C) THEN "Equilateral" WHEN (A=B) OR (C=A) OR (B=C) THEN "Isosceles" ELSE "Scalene" END FROM TRIANGLES;
